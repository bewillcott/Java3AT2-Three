# Java3 AT2 Question 3
This is a TAFE assignment for the Diploma in Software Development, at the South Metropolitan TAFE,
Rockingham, Western Australia.

The project task is to develop an application that creates a list of integers between 1 and 10 million.
It needs the ability to sort in at least three different styles with timers to indicate the speed at which this 
happens.

## Implementation
This project consists of 3 sub-projects within the aggregator project:

- Common
- ConsoleApp
- GUIApp

### Common
This is a non-executable jar, containing a collection of classes that are in 'common' use across 
multiple projects.  It contains the Sorting class.

### ConsoleApp
An application that tests the sorting algorithms and outputs the collected results into a CSV file.

### GUIApp
A GUI application that allows the user to select one of four sorting algorithms to sort a large 
number on integers.
